# What to install?

## General requirements

### Python3

Installation of any of the **vantage6** packages requires Python ‚â• 3.6. For installation instructions, see [python.org](https://python.org), [anaconda.com](https://anaconda.com) or use the package manager native to your OS and/or distribution \(e.g. `apt` for debian or Ubuntu, `yum` for fedora, or `yast` for SuSE\).

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend you install **vantage6** in a new, clean environment.
{% endhint %}

### Docker

Running a node _always_ requires the Docker runtime to be installed \(and running\). Running the server only requires docker when it's run as a dockerized application. 

The correct installation of docker can be verified with the following command:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

{% hint style="info" %}
üê≥ Always make sure that Docker is running!

üê≥ If this command is not successful, please see [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions specific for your platform.
{% endhint %}

### **vantage6**

**vantage6** consists of several components that can be installed and run in several different ways. Which component\(s\) you need, and how you wish to install them, depends on your use case.

There are three \(or four\) components to consider:

1. The **server**
2. A **node**
3. The **client**
4. A Docker **registry**

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using Windows, make sure you [share ](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)you're drives with Docker.
{% endhint %}

The server and the node can be _run_ through [Docker](https://www.docker.com) \(preferably\) or _installed_ as regular Python packages/applications. We will cover both options in the following sections.
