# Docker registry

A registry \(repository\) provides storage and versioning for Docker images. Installing a \(private\) Docker registry can be useful if you want to securely host your own algorithms. 

### Docker registry

Docker provides a registry as a turn-key solution on Docker Hub. Instructions for setting it up can be found here: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry). 

### Harbor

Harbor \([https://goharbor.io](https://goharbor.io)\) is another option for running a registry. In addition it also provides things like access control.
