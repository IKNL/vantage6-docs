# Running the server

## üíª Server Commands

The following sub-commands are available to manage the server\(s\). These commands can also be found by simply calling `vserver` .

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `vserver files` | List the file locations of the server instance |
| `vserver import` | Import server entities as a batch |
| `vserver list` | List the available server instances |
| `vserver new` | Create a new server configuration |
| `vserver shell` | Run a server instance python shell |
| `vserver start` | Start a server configuration |

## üÜï \(Re-\)Configuring a Server

Servers are created from a configuration file. This file can be created through command `vserver new`or creating a YAML file manually. See [this ](server-configuration.md)section on how to do this. 

## üì• Importing entities

When you start a new server \(or when you just want to load/import new data\) you can use the `vserver import FILE` command. See [this](importing-entities.md) section for more details.

## üè§ Managing Server Data

Managing entities at the server \(e.g. users, organizations, etc...\) is usually done through the RESTful API. As administrator you also have access to a Python API by using the command `vserver shell` which opens an iPython shell in which all database models are available. To see what you can do with these models, see [this](shell.md) page!

## üèé Starting the server

Once the configuration is done and you created at least one user, you can start the server instance by using `vserver start` and then selecting the configuration you want to use.  Or if you already know the name of the configuration you can use the `--name` flag to specify it. If you have a configuration file which is in a non-default location than you can specify this by the `--config` flag. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that having Docker installed is **not** strictly  necessary to run the server. However, it is needed if you want to run a private registry on the same machine. See [Docker registry](../../installation/docker-registry.md) for details.
{% endhint %}

## üßÅ Deployment of a Production environment

We give some recommendations for deploying VANTAGE6-server in [this](deployment.md) section.

## ‚úç Logging

If logging to the console is enabled, starting the server or loading the fixtures should output some information that can be helpful in determining the cause of problems. For example, the output below shows:

* Which environment was used
* What configuration file was used
* Which database was used

```bash
