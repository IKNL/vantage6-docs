# üöÑ What is vantage6

vantage6 stands for privacy preserving [federated learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning) infrastructure for secure insight exchange.

The project is inspired by the [Personal Health Train](https://pht.health-ri.nl/) (PHT) concept. In this analogy _vantage6_ are the tracks upon the algorithms can run.

vantage6 is here for

* delivering algorithms to data stations and collect their results
* manage users, organizations, collaborations, computation tasks and their results
* providing control (security) at the data-stations by their owners

vantage6 does/is _not_ (yet)

* formats the data at the data station
* aligns data across the data stations
* a finished/polished product

vantage6 is designed with three fundamental functional aspects of Federated learning.

1. Autonomy. All involved parties should remain independent and autonomous.
2. Heterogeneity. Parties should be allowed to have differences in hardware and operating systems.
3. Flexibility. Related to the latter, a federated learning infrastructure should not limit the use of relevant data.
