# How to contribute

## :woman\_technologist: If you're a developer

* Join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/tR7tqCt), and get into the Development section.
* The first area where you can help is bug fixing. Please check our[ issue list](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues) at Github to see if you can help.&#x20;
* A great way to learn about the source is writing unit-tests to test existing components. This helps us getting our [coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/IKNL/ppDLI?branch=master) up.
* Maintaining good [code quality](https://app.codacy.com/manual/frankcorneliusmartin/ppDLI/dashboard) is important, so do some housekeeping, refactoring and cleaning really helps us writing good code.
* Writing documentation, both in the code and on this Documentation page.

## :man\_scientist: If you're a tester (and breaker)

* Join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/tR7tqCt),  and get into the Development section.
* Feel free to install our development version of vantage6 and try to break it.
* Issues can be reported on our [Github page](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6).

## :police\_officer: If you're into security, privacy&#x20;

One of the top priorities of vantage6 is being secure in what it does. Therefore having people reporting possible security issues to us is immensely helpful. If you have security concerns please report them directly to [f.martin@iknl.nl](mailto:f.martin@iknl.nl) or [b.vanbeusekom@iknl.nl](mailto:b.vanbeusekom@iknl.nl).
