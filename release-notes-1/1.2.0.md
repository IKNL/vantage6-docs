# 1.2.0

* Cross language serialization. Enabling algorithm developers to write algorithms that are not language dependent. 
* Collaboration name needs to be unique
*  API consistency and bug fixes:
  * GET `organization` was missing domain key
  * PATCH `/organization` could not patch domain
  * GET `/collaboration/{id}/node` has been made consistent with `/node`
  * GET `/collaboration/{id}/organization` has been made consistent with `/organization`
  * PATCH `/user` root-user was not able to update users
  * DELETE `/user` root-user was not able to delete users
  * GET `/task` null values are now consistent: `[]` is replaced by `null` 
  * POST, PATCH, DELETE `/node` root-user was not able to perform these actions
  * GET `/node/{id}/task` output is made consistent with the 
* `questionairy` dependency is updated to 1.5.2
* Reset password is added to the API. For this purpose two endpoints have been added: `/recover/lost`and `recover/reset` . The server config file needs to extended to be connected to a mail-server in order to make this work.
* User table in the database is extended to contain an email address which is mandatory.
